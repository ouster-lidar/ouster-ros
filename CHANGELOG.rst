ouster_ros
----------
* breaking change: renamed ``ouster_ros/ros.h`` to ``ouster_ros/os_ros.h`` and
  ``ouster_ros/point.h`` to ``ouster_ros/os_point.h``.
* breaking change: change the type of the ring field within ``ouster::Point`` from ``uint8_t`` to
  ``uint16_t``
* correct LICENSE file installation path.
* update code files copyrights period.
* bug fix: ros driver doesn't use correct udp_dest given by user during launch
* update published TF transforms time with senosr or ros time based on the
  active timestamp mode.
* validate lidar and imu port values. warn users when assigning random port numbers.
* switch to using the cartesianT method when populating pcl point cloud for performance and reduced
  cpu utilization
* reduce dynamic memory allocation within the driver for performance and driver stability
* add ``pcl_ros`` as a dependency to ``package.xml``

ouster_client
--------------
* breaking change: signal multiplier type changed to double to support new FW values of signal
  multiplier.
* breaking change: make_xyz_lut takes mat4d beam_to_lidar_transform instead of
  lidar_origin_to_beam_origin_mm double to accomodate new FWs. Old reference Python implementation
  was kept, but new reference was also added.
* address an issue that could cause the processed frame being dropped in favor or the previous
  frame when the frame_id wraps-around.
* added a new flag ``CONFIG_FORCE_REINIT`` for ``set_config()`` method, to force the sensor to reinit
  even when config params have not changed.
* breaking change: drop defaults parameters from the shortform ``init_client()`` method.
* added a new method ``init_logger()`` to provide control over the logs emitted by ``ouster_client``.
* add parsing for new FW 3.0 thermal features shot_limiting and thermal_shutdown statuses and countdowns
* add frame_status to LidarScan
* introduced a new method ``cartesianT()`` which speeds up the computation of point projecion from range
  image, the method also can process the cartesian product with single float precision. A new unit test
  ``cartesian_test`` which shows achieved speed up gains by the number of valid returns in lidar scan.
* added ``RAW_HEADERS`` ChanField to LidarScan for packing headers and footer (alpha version, may be
  changed/removed without notice in the future)
